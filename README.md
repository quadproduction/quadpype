## 📜 **History**

**QuadPype** is the updated and maintained successor of [**OpenPype**](https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype). The core maintainers of **OpenPype** have decided to create a new product called **AYON**, but this solution seems to us over-complexify the goal of a simple to install, setup, configure and use pipeline solution. This is why we decided to create this repository.

But **OpenPype** isn't the starting point of this pipeline solution, a lot of people have worked on multiple open source projects to get to the point we are today.

These are the projects that leads us to create **QuadPype**:
