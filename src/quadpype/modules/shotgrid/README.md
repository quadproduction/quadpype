- Create a new QuadPype project with the **project manager**

- Inform the shotgrid authentication infos (url, script name, api key) and the shotgrid project ID related to this QuadPype project in the **project settings**

- Use the batch interface (Tray > shotgrid > Launch batch), select your project and click "batch"

- You can now access your shotgrid entities within the **avalon launcher** and publish informations to shotgrid with **pyblish**
