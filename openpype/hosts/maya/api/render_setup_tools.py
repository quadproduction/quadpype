    When exporting from Render Setup layer Maya by default
    forces a switch to the defaultRenderLayer as such making
    it impossible to export the contents of a Render Setup
    layer. Maya presents this warning message:
        # Warning: Exporting Render Setup master layer content #

    This function however avoids the renderlayer switch and
    exports from the Render Setup layer as if the edits were
    'flattened' in the master layer.

    It does so by:
        - Allowing export from Render Setup Layer
        - Enforce Render Setup nodes to NOT be written on export
        - Disconnect connections from any `applyOverride` nodes
          to flatten the values (so they are written correctly)*
    *Connection overrides like Shader Override and Material
    Overrides export correctly out of the box since they don't
    create an intermediate connection to an 'applyOverride' node.
    However, any scalar override (absolute or relative override)
    will get input connections in the layer so we'll break those
    to 'store' the values on the attribute itself and write value
    out instead.

    Args:
        path (str): File path to export to.
        nodes (list): Maya nodes to export.
        export (callable, optional): Callback to be used for exporting. If
            not specified, default export to `.ma` will be called.

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        AssertionError: When not in a Render Setup layer an
            AssertionError is raised. This command assumes
            you are currently in a Render Setup layer.
