## Version already exists

Version {version} you have set on instance '{subset_name}' under '{asset_name}' already exists. This validation is enabled by default to prevent accidental override of existing versions.

### How to repair?
- Click on 'Repair' action -> this will change version to next available.
- Disable validation on the instance if you are sure you want to override the version.
- Reset publishing and manually change the version number.
